Dogs  Search  Portal

users enter their name and email on a login screen. Then, you should use this information to hit our login endpoint to authenticate with our service (see API Reference below).

Once a user is successfully authenticated, they should be brought to a search page where they can browse available dogs. This page must meet the following requirements:

Users must be able to filter by breed
Results should be paginated
Results should be sorted alphabetically by breed by default. Users should be able to modify this sort to be ascending or descending.
All fields of the Dog object (except for id) must be presented in some form
Users should be able to select their favorite dogs from the search results. When finished searching, they should be able to generate a match based on dogs added to the favorites list. A single match will be generated by sending all favorited dog IDs to the /dogs/match endpoint. You should display this match however you see fit.
